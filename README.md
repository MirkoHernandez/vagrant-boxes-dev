# vagrant-boxes-dev

Easy to setup vagrant development environments for Django and
PostgreSQL.

These days I'm using the much superior GNU Guix for development
environments. Fast, with containers and provisioning that can be
configured at the commit level. It removes the need for pip (can be
used through Guix) and virtualenv.
